data sets
I have uploaded the required data sets in BaiduYun Drive

As some readers mentioned, I also provided the download url for Google driver.

which are generated by saving the numpy arrays loaded from original provided .txt files.

Then, directly move the channel_train.npy and channel_test.npy to current file. Namely, the paths are './channel_train.npy' and './channel_test.npy'.

Original datasets is provided in https://github.com/haoyye/OFDM_DNN as txt.file, which may cost much time to load the data. Therefore, I save enough samples as the .npy files, so that the training sets can be loaded easily and also reduce the file size.
